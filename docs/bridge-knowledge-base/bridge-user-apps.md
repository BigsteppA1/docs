## Wormhole

You can transfer your assets between networks through [Wormhole](https://wormhole.darwinia.network/). 

For the User Guide of Wormhole, please click [here](https://docs.darwinia.network/tutorials/wiki-tut-wormhole). 

At present, the bridge between Darwinia and Ethereum has already been deployed and running smoothly for some time. We have also launched the test bridge between Pangolin(our testnet) and Pangoro(Pangolin's twin network). When the test bridge becomes stable, we will launch the bridge between Darwinia and Crab. Meanwhile, we are planning and developing the bridge between Darwinia and BSC.

## Apps

You can send and receive crypto assets on Darwinia/Crab network by [Apps](https://apps.darwinia.network/#/account), and earn token rewards by staking in [Apps](https://apps.darwinia.network/#/account).
For the User Guide of the Apps, there are a series of tutorials for reference, please click [here](https://docs.darwinia.network/tutorials/quick-start-account).

## Smart App

The [Smart App](https://smart.darwinia.network/) is a wallet that provides a user-friendly solution for transferring assets between the DVM account and the Substrate account.

> The DVM account/address format is consistent with that in Ethereum, so is the generation method. The difference is that each DVM account/address corresponds to a unique Substrate account address. In other words, the DVM address is first an Ethereum address, but it also corresponds to a Substrate address. Currently, you can use the Apps tool to generate the Stustrate address from the DVM address. Since the DVM and the Ethereum virtual machines are compatible with the underlying specifications, users can use the wallets from the existing Ethereum ecosystem to manage their assets, such as Metamask. For more details about the address, you can click [here](https://docs.crab.network/dvm/wallets/dvm-metamask).
