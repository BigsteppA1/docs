## Wormhole

You can transfer your assets between multiple networks through [Wormhole](https://wormhole.darwinia.network/). 

About the Wormhole user guide, please click [here](https://docs.darwinia.network/tutorials/wiki-tut-wormhole). 

At present, the bridge between Darwinia and Ethereum has already been implemented and running awhile, and we have launched the test bridge between Pangroro and Pangolin, after the test bridge is stable, we'll launch the bridge between Darwinia and Crab. At meanwhile, we are planning and developing the bridge between Darwinia and BSC.

## Apps

## Smart App

The [Smart App](https://smart.darwinia.network/) is a wallet that provides a user-friendly solution for transferring assets between DVM account and Substrate accounts.

> The DVM account address format is consistent with the Ethereum account address format and the generation method. The difference is that each DVM account address corresponds to a unique Substrate account address. In other words, the DVM address is first an Ethereum address, but it also corresponds to a Substrate address in addition to the Ethereum address. Currently, you can use the Apps tool to generate the Stustrate address corresponding to the DVM address. Since the DVM and the Ethereum virtual machine are compatible in the underlying specifications, users can use the wallets from the existing Ethereum ecosystem to manage their assets, such as Metamask. For more details about the address, you can click [here](https://docs.crab.network/dvm/wallets/dvm-metamask).
