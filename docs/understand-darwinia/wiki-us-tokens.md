## KTON

KTON is essentially a derivative token of RING, which encourages long-term lock and commitment. RING staking participants can lock RING for 1-36s months and get KTON as rewards, compensating for the liquidity loss.

- The initial supply of KTON is 0, and it can only be obtained by locking RING. There is no other distribution channel. KTON has no impact on the function of  RING.

### Algorithm of binding RING for KTON

Users can lock a certain amount of RING for a predefined period of time in exchange for KTON in return. Basically bind 10,000 RING for 12 months to get 1 KTON.

1-36 variable integer months(30days) as the locking period are allowed. See the following table of rewarded KTON amount according to locked period.
