## Intro

You can transfer your tokens on your Ethereum account to the Darwinia mainnet and use them for staking to take advantage of the current high ROE. This article will show you how to perform Ethereum-to-Darwinia transfer.

## Prerequisites

In order to proceed with the following operation, you need to meet these prerequisites.
- The browser extension [*Polkadot.js*](./quick-start-account.md) is installed and correctly configured. 
- The Ethereum wallet [*MetaMask*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) is installed and correclty configured. 
- You have enough ETH and Rings on your account to cover the transaction fee and gas fee.

## Steps

Before you start, you need to have your Darwinia account(address) prepared. This address starts with "2" and can be found on the top right part of the window when you log into [Darwinia Apps Portal](https://apps.darwinia.network/). It can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the account icon.

Then you can visit [Darwinia Wormhole](https://wormhole.darwinia.network/) to perform cross-chain transfer. Refer to [Wormhole User Guide](./wiki-tut-wormhole.md) for details of operation.

## Withdraw from a Centralized Exchange

If you purchase rings from a centralized exchange, you need to withdraw them from your exchange account to your MetaMask Ethereum wallet before transferring them to your Darwinia account.

There are a variety of exchanges that support rings transaction. Steps may vary from exchange to exchange. You should resort to their documentation to find out how to withdraw. But ensure to select the ERC20 chain; otherwise, you may suffer the loss of your assets.
