### I’m new to Darwinia. Where is the best place to start?

First and foremost, hello and welcome to the Darwinia Network Community! Darwinia is a trustless and decentralized cross-chain bridge protocol developed by Itering on Substrate that provides interoperability and identifiability of tokens between modern and legacy blockchains such as between Polkadot, TRON, and Ethereum networks, and more.

### What is the history of Darwinia Network?

The Darwinia Network project started in late 2018 when Parity released the Substrate toolkit project. Darwinia implements a decentralized network that plays as a relayer chain between major blockchains and enables asset transfers in a decentralized and permissionless non-custodial way.


* Darwinia was designed to operate as a parachain of Polkadot but can also work in Solo mode as an independent network with its own consensus, security, and cross-chain functionality which adopted for backup and mitigation of Polkadot-based technical issues.
  
* Darwinia team has developed an Application SDK based on Polkadot’s Substrate and Darwinia Web applications in order to facilitate the development of different applications running on Darwinia Network.

* We’ve also developed a leading blockchain explorer [Subscan](https://www.subscan.io/) for Polkadot and Substrate Community.


Before launching Darwinia, the team also developed several other products including the blockchain-based game [Evolution Land](https://www.evolution.land/), Itering ID, Itering DKMS Solution, etc.

* **DKMS**: A Decentralized Key Management System
* **Subscan**: A high precision blockchain data explorer and visualization tool for Substrate-based blockchains.
* **Itering ID**: A set of air-gapped signing tools, capable of tranferring by scanning QR code
* **NFT Shifter**: An easy to use tool to create and deploy blockchain NFT assets.
* **Evolution Land**: A cross-chain blockchain game to demostrate blockchain capabilities and get users onbord to Darwinia Network.

### What is the relationship between Darwinia Network and Evolution Land?

Evolution Land is the first cross-chain game in the Darwinia Network ecosystem. Please check out more details here: [EvolutionLand Docs](https://docs.evolution.land/)

<hr />

### What is the relationship between Darwinia Network and Polkadot? 

Darwinia Network is the first game chain on Polkadot. The development of Darwinia network is based on Polkadot and Substrate framework. Darwinia network will play as a parachain of the Polkadot network in the near future.

<hr />

### What will happen if Darwinia Network is no longer a parachain?

Even if Darwinia Network will be voted off the Polkadot parachain set, it wil still work as a "Solo Chain" with it's its own consensus and security infrastructure.

### What are RING and KTON in Evolution Land?

RING and KTON in Evolution Land is the ERC-20/TRC-20 token. Evolution Land use RING in Darwinia Network as the payment token in game.
